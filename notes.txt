I cloned this project to my lenovo machine. I have not worked on my lenovo machine for a bit, because it had a battery issue. I think
    I fixed the issue. I did a npm install -g live-server. It did not work initially, I had to manually go to settings(json) and add 
        "liveServer.settings.port": 5501. That worked.  

buffalo.js is the latest code that I am working on. as I work to compare my code I am naming them by numbers. buffalo2.js is my oldest work.

    I like what I have on buffalo.js for right now. I tried to use getters and setters initially (buffalo3.js), but, I could not get that 
    to work, and I do not believe that that was the best way to go about it anyhow. In buffalo4.js I tried to use Object.define, that works 
    fine, but, I realized that I could abstract all that code. So I did so in buffalo.js.
    Satisfied with this for now. The real goal was to understand getters and setters, but, for what I wanted for this code -which was to
    reuse just one object for all characters- it was not necessary. 

    I just pulled this without a merge request. I was not supposed to be able to do that. Gotta check on that.

    on my lenovo machine, when doing a git pull, it did not update the code automatically. I had to do it manually.
    ////test
    ok. I finally got it to work. I had a situation where I was confused on which branch I was on. I had a couple lenovo branches. I think because 
    maybe i was not deleting branches? I deleted everything and now I have it fixed.
    Still some issues. I switched to the branch "test" that I created.
